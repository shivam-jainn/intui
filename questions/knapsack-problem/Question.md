# Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of `n` items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

In other words, given two integer arrays `val[0..n-1]` and `wt[0..n-1]` which represent values and weights associated with `n` items respectively. Also given an integer `W` which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of `val[]` such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to `W`.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `val = [60, 100, 120], wt = [10, 20, 30], W = 50`
**Output:** `220`

### Example 2:
**Input:** `val = [40, 100, 50, 70], wt = [10, 20, 30, 10], W = 40`
**Output:** `210`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= W <= 1000`
- `1 <= val[i], wt[i] <= 1000`
